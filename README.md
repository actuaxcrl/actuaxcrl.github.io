## My Favorite Hobby

**Dancing**

Dancing is the no. 1 hobby that I LOVE to do. Ever since I was a child, I already started dancing until now. When my mom knew this talent of mine, mom was over the moon of hapinness and excitement. It's only the talent that I always brag to my friends. Sometimes I joined some intermission numbers for my family's events. Also, I was part of our dance troup or "modern dancers" of my school in grade school (starting 1st - 6th grade). Dancing strenghtens my confidence, it is my source of expressing my emotions or feelings.

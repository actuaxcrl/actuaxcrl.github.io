## Welcome to Mary's Github Page! 
Hello po! I'm Mary, a student from Ateneo de Naga University, a Eccedentesiast & Slubberdegullion
Some of my friends call me "Jollibee" because of my second name that looks like the name jollibee. So I just embraced that name and I'm happy because it also give them smiles in their faces whenever they hear that name "Jollibee". <33

## My Favorite Hobby

**Dancing**

Dancing is the no. 1 hobby that I LOVE to do. Ever since I was a child, I already started dancing until now. When my mom knew this talent of mine, mom was over the moon of happiness and excitement. It's only the talent that I always brag to my friends. Sometimes I joined some intermission numbers for my family's events. Also, I was part of our dance troupe or "modern dancers" of my school in grade school (starting 1st - 6th grade). Dancing strengthens my confidence, it is my source of expressing my emotions or feelings.

## Movies/series that I've watched:
- Maleficent 1 and 2
- Sunrise in Heaven
- Goblin
- Squid Game

I'm more interested in watching love-sad-adventure stories, idk why maybe because it's so fun to watch.. Watching movies also makes me calm and reduce my stress.
